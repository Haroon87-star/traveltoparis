    <h2>Information About Paris</h2>
    <p id="tourists"> Paris is well-hyped and delivers on that hype.<strong>Paris is popular among tourists for many of the same reasons that New York City is </strong>: because it is a city that's been memorialized by <em>artists</em> of every type either through their work or their personal rhapsodizing.

     <p id="paris">Paris, <em>France's</em> capital,<strong>is a major European city and a global center for art, fashion, gastronomy and culture</strong>.<br>
      Its 19th-century cityscape is crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the <em>River Seine</em>.<br>
      Beyond such landmarks as the <em>Eiffel Tower</em> and the 12th-century, <em>Gothic Notre-Dame cathedral</em>, <strong>the city is known for its cafe culture and designer boutiques along the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people assume that <em>Paris</em> is called<strong>The City of Light</strong> because of its dazzling <em>boulevards and bridges</em>, and it’s easy to see why.Today, there are over 296 illuminated sites in Paris, if you count everything from hotels and churches, statues and fountains, national buildings and monuments, and out of 37 major bridges in Paris, an impressive 33 of them are illuminated to full glory each sunset.</p>

    <p class="landmark"> However, it’s Paris’s most famous landmark, the glittering <em>Eiffel Tower</em>, that’s mainly to blame for the misinterpretation<strong>.<br>
      The monument shines like a beacon each night with 40km of illuminated garlands made up of 20,000 light bulbs</strong>.</p>
